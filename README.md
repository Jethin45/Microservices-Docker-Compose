### Microservices-Docker-Compose

#### Description:
###### Containerize microservices using Docker and orchestrate them with Docker Compose. This project demonstrates the implementation of a microservices architecture where each service is encapsulated within a Docker container. The services communicate with each other, and the entire application stack is defined and managed using Docker Compose.

#### Key Features:

###### Dockerization of individual microservices.
###### Orchestration of services using Docker Compose.
###### Communication between microservices within a Docker network.
###### Sample Node.js microservices showcasing basic functionality.

#### How To:

###### Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
###### Use Docker Compose to define the application stack.
###### Demonstrate communication between microservices.

#### Notes:

###### The project includes two sample microservices (service1 and service2).
###### Each microservice has its own Dockerfile and is defined in the docker-compose.yml.
###### The services can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:4000 respectively.

#### Technologies:

###### Docker
###### Docker Compose
###### Node.js
###### Express
